Additional features in comparison to dc42's and/or RRP's official firmware:

* Cooling support: M106 can invert PWM cooling if "I1" is passed to it once (required for a 4-pin PWM fan)

* EMAC: Interrupt-driven input and optimized output mechanism

* FTP server support with long file lists (up to 6KB)

* Telnet support

* Config output: M503 removes duplicate whitespaces to display the new RRP config template completely on the web interface

* Cold extrudes: M302 can allow or deny them with the "P" parameter, it reports the status if no arguments are specified

* Discrimination between cold extrudes and cold retracts for filament changing (minimum retraction temperature is 90Â°C)

* Z-probing: M558 can be used to specify the axes for which the Z probe will be used (e.g. M558 P1 X0 Y0 Z1 for Z-probing only)

* File information for files being printed are displayed on page reload (except for layer stats)

* Lowered minimum extrusion temperature from 170C to 160C

* Reduced Z-probe height for automatic bed compensation from 8mm to 5mm

* Added interrupt to pin 25 (Duet) / pin 10 (Duex4) on the expansion header for 4-pin PWM tacho line (can be viewed with my web interface fork)

* Firmware binaries are built with -O3 optimization enabled

* File information can be retrieved from G-Code files generated by common slicers (Slic3r, Cura and S3D)

* When axes are being homed and axis drives are disabled, the according homing states are reset

* If the print was paused, M0 will neither deselect the current tool nor turn off any heaters
  Use my web interface fork (version 1.08+) to restart failed prints easily on demand

* M0 puts drives into idle state, M1 turns them off (thanks dc42)

* M0 and M1 run stop.g and sleep.g before everything is switched off

* Ability to specify which drives may be disabled by M18 and M84

* Buffered G-codes are enqueued if moves are being performed to ensure all codes are executed just-in-time

* When prints are paused, movement stops as soon as the current move has finished

* When prints are either being stopped or resumed, macro files (pause.g or resume.g) are executed

* Implemented 'R' paramter for G0/G1 to be able to go to the coordinates a print was initially paused at

* default.g is executed if config.g cannot be found (same behaviour as with versions older than 0.90)

* config.g has been removed from the SD-image directory, copy default.g to create it

* Z-probe modulation pin may be set using M558 'R' parameter (thanks dc42)

* X-axis direction remains compatible with prior releases, meaning all stepper motor connectors on a Duet v0.6 are connected the same way round.
  This was changed once more with RRP's dev FW 0.90 and their official 0.78 FW, however my Ormerod 1 "default.g" file has been updated to compensate this

* Total extruder positions since power up, last G92 or last M23 are reported to the web interface.
  This includes raw extruder positions without the extrusion multipliers applied to them, to improve filament estimation (requires web interfacae version 1.06+ to work)

* Current fan value is reported by M106 and included in the web interface status response

* Added 'R' parameter to M106 to restore the last-known fan value after it has been turned off. It may also be used to maintain this value

* Implemented M500, M501 and M502 (EEPROM tools) and made Flash usage optional when building the firmware.
  Passing 'S1' to M501 will enable auto-save for non-volatile parameters, so backward compatibility with forks based on dc42's firmware can be maintained.

* Implemented M32 (Select file and start SD print)

* Print status is not changed when a macro file is being executed unless it's part of a real G-Code file

* New-style JSON status and config responses (see http://reprap.org/wiki/Proposed_RepRap_Duet_Status_Responses) including firmware-based print end-time estimations

* Move class can perform isolated moves (without the look-ahead ring) when a print has been paused

* Firmware can be built using a custom Arduino device tree (see Data/Firmware build instructions.odt)

* Bug fix: Old-fashioned G32 call (without macro utilisation) initially resets bed compensation parameters

* Bug fix: Actual extruder positions are reported instead of the internal ones from the GCodes class

* Bug fix: Layer height and filament usage for web interface are read from both start and end of a gcode file
