Custom hardware tree for the Duet platform (version 1.0.1)

Set the private library path to this directory in the Arduino Eclipse plugin settings to compile RepRapFirmware.
This tree is based upon the official "Arduino Due" platform files, however the following changes were made:

- WString class is no longer present in the Arduino core. Use char arrays in conjunction with StringRef containers instead
- EMAC RX buffers were increased to 128*32 for optimal network performance
- UART classes were expanded by a "canWrite" method for better sending performance
- Watchdog is enabled by default to avoid potential overheating in case a firmware crash occurs

All of these files are licensed under the terms and conditions of the GPL.

Many thanks to David Crocker aka dc42 for providing the initial Arduino core patches!
